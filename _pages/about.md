Welcome to my personal website, more details to be updated soon!

About me:
I'm a researcher by training, and tech strategy consultant by trade. I am currently with ByteDance/TikTok working on AGI strategy. Prior to that, I was a consultant at McKinsey advising Fortune 500 software, banking company execs primarily on AI commercialization, tech modernization strategies. I finished PhD at Stanford using AI to build battery models at the nanoscale by extracting the underlying physics (i.e., mathematical differential equations governing the batteries) during charging and discharging combining AI, numerical computation, and scientific imaging.
