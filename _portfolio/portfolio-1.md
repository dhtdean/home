Winner of [2024 Berkeley LLM agent hackathon](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/llm-agents-hackathon/) in the application track, with ~3k participants. 

While GenAI has a lot of B2B use cases, its potential in the B2C space remains largely untapped. That’s why we built Smooth Operator—an AI voice agent designed to tackle low frequency, but high-variance situations, like consultation and negotiation in our daily lives.

Our first application? Simplifying the moving process—an expensive and stressful experience for many. Check out our website for more [details](https://eyecognito.netlify.app/llm-agents-hackathon)!
